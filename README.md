# Ames Houses Prices Regression

## Description

This project explores a dataset from the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). The objective is to build machine learning regression models to predict house prices based on various features related to the houses' attributes and conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It contains detailed information about houses in Ames, Iowa, including numerous features that influence house prices. The goal is to use this data to build predictive models.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- A virtual Python environment is recommended (via `venv` or `conda`)
- The following libraries must be installed:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook to run the `ames_house_prices_regression.ipynb` file

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Dan-Popescu/Ames_Houses_Prices_Regression_Notebook.git
   cd Ames_Houses_Prices_Regression_Notebook
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download data from Kaggle ([House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)) and place it in the `data` folder.

5. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ames_houses_prices_regression.ipynb
   ```

6. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the analysis and models.
